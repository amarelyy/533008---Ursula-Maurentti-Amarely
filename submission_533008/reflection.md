**#Project Reflection**

	This smart contract project provided invaluable hands-on experience with blockchain development. I learned the complete lifecycle of creating a decentralized application - from writing Solidity code to deploying on the Sepolia testnet. The most challenging aspect was navigating the deployment process and understanding gas fees, but overcoming these hurdles gave me practical insights into real-world App development.
	
	The "Proof of Existence" concept perfectly demonstrates blockchain's utility for trustless verification. We maintain document privacy while creating immutable timestamps by storing only cryptographic hashes. This has powerful applications in document notarization, intellectual property protection, and legal evidence.
	
	I gained proficiency with essential tools like Remix IDE, MetaMask, and Etherscan. Debugging transaction errors taught me valuable troubleshooting skills that classroom theory couldn't provide. Understanding how mappings, events, and require statements work in practice solidified my Solidity knowledge.
	
	If I were to improve this project, I would add access controls and explore gas optimization techniques. This project confirmed blockchain's potential beyond cryptocurrencies and inspired me to explore more complex smart contract applications. The hands-on approach made abstract concepts tangible and memorable.
