## **Project Reflection**

	Diving into blockchain felt unfamiliar, as this was a new concept for me. Building this smart contract gave me hands-on experience with it. I went from writing my first code in Solidity all the way to deploying it on the Sepolia Testnet. The "Proof of Existence" concept is a perfect example of what makes blockchain a special technology. With the hashing process, you can prove the existence of your document without even showing the content of your private document to others.
	I gained an understanding of essential tools like Remix IDE, MetaMask, and Etherscan. One of the unique insights that I gained is about the gas cost. Apparently, there is a fee that you need to pay for the computational energy your code uses, which really makes you think about writing efficient smart contracts. If I were to improve this project, I would like to explore more about gas optimization techniques and apply them to the smart contract. This project also confirmed the potential use of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies, and it's got me really excited to see other implementations.
